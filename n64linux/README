N64 Linux
=========

This is a port of Linux to the N64. Only native drivers for now,
that is, no Everdrive or 64drive specials. Expansion pak required.

As a 64-bit MIPS BE system, it can run 32- and 64-bit kernels. The kernel
included in this ROM is 64-bit.

The userspace ABI supported depends on the kernel. A 32-bit kernel
supports O32, 64-bit supports everything (if enabled in config).
The N32 ABI is the best one, giving 64-bit regs but 32-bit pointers.

I found uclibc-ng was broken for MIPS N32, so I used musl. No toolchain
supplied, bring your own.

The port currently runs on modern LLE emulators such as Ares and
dgb-n64. A heavily patched cen64 was used during development. Even with
all the patches it's unstable and buggy in cen64, a big difference to hw.

And yes, it's constantly flirting with OOM.

Boot order
----------

Bootloader -> kernel -> small built-in initramfs -> cart disk image

The bootloader only needs to be recompiled if you want to change the
command line. Otherwise you can drop in new kernels and disk images
into the ROM, by truncating it to the first 1mb-8kb and using n64tool.

Changing the built-in initramfs requires recompiling the kernel.
